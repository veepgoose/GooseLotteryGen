# High Goose Lottery Number Generator

Welcome to the High Goose Lottery Number Generator repository! This lighthearted React app is designed to generate random lottery numbers with a touch of humor. It's a fun showcase of my skills as a software developer, and a testament to how far I've come since my coding bootcamp days.

## Overview

The "High Goose Lottery Number Generator" is a simple web application that prompts users to enter their name and make some whimsical commitments before clicking "Submit to the High Goose." Once submitted, the app generates six random lottery numbers.

## Features

- User-friendly React-based interface.
- Name input for a personalised touch.
- Playful questions like "Are you ready to bow down to the High Goose?" and "Do you agree to give up your first-born child?"
- Submit button with a humorous label: "Submit to the High Goose."

## Why I Built This

I originally created a similar app using basic prompt/alert pop-ups during the first week of my coding bootcamp. However, I decided to revisit and enhance it using React to demonstrate my growth as a developer. The app serves both as a learning exercise and a fun concept.
